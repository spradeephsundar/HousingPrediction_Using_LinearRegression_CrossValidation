## Additional Information
- General information: The overall idea is to predict the house prices using linear regression. 
- The steps are as follows: Build a linear regression model without cross validation, Perform k-fold cross validation, Hyperparameter tuning using cross validation and Build a final model (based on the parameters finalized)
- Business problem: To predict the house prices using linear regression. 
- Dataset: The dataset consisted of 545 rows and 13 columns.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

## Conclusions
- A model based on cross validation with Linear regression was built, to predict the house prices.
